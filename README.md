# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
It tooks me probably more than 30 hours
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. 
See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I can quickly conceptualize the basic structure of the program and the knowledge needed compared to the previous

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
Part of the content needs to ask for help from classmates or the Internet, and the ideas are not clear enough

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
kivy related content

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
Clear my mind and organize my knowledge

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
Repeatedly study the weekly exercises and summarize the important points, and then use a notepad to record them.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
Each function can be completed successfully, but the whole procedure is completely confused when finishing the idea, resulting in a lot of time and energy wasted

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
A class is a collection of data, an abstract collection of operation descriptions.
